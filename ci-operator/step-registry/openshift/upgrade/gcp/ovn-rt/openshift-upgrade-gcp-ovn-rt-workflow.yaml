    The Openshift E2E GCP OVN Realtime Kernel workflow executes the upgrade end-to-end test suite on GCP with a default cluster
    configuration and Loki as log collector, exercising an upgrade during the process. The realtime test are run before and after
    the upgrade to ensure conformance with realtime testing tools after the upgrade.
